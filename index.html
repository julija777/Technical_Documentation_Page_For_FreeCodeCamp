                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe 
                    the presentation of a document written in HTML or
                    XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                    CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on
                    paper, in speech, or on other media.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized 
                    across Web browsers according to W3C specifications.
                    Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was 
                    done synchronously, which allowed versioning of the
                    latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3.
                    However, CSS4 has never become an official
                    version.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started to
                        differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations separately per module. Instead of
                        versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS
                        specification.

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and
                    spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module
                    provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks
                    like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

                <p>
                    This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax,
                    and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and
                    inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and
                    lots more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential
                    theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.

                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.

                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
    
                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined</code>

            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                    pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                    variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                    frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                    name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                    document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                    parent.phoneNumber.

            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
    
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                    represent a variable.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
    
                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
            CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
            }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                                other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                unique and immutable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
    
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
            } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
          </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
    
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
    
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
    
                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
    
                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                    the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                    tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                    control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                    those statements.
                </p>
    
                Example:
    
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
    
                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                    true, so the loop terminates.

            <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
    
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                        separated by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                        brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>
    
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                    consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                    function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                    specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                    value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                    the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                    the calling function.
